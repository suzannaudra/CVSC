# Causation vs. Correlation

### Description

Causation vs. Correlation presents to different sets of data for the user to compare. Each data set is graphed together in a multi-line chart in order to better illustrate difference between the trends. The user can then vote on whether they think there is a "causation" or "correlation" between the two sets of data. Voting results from all users will be displayed on the page so the user can see how their vote compares with other people.
